title: Welcome to the Trials and Tribulations of coding in R
---

This is an open lab notebook created by Dr. Nyssa Silbiger. Here, you will find posts based on weekly coding sessions. Each week I give short lesson on a specific coding in R problem. All those lessons will be posted here. Also, I will be posting any coding roadblocks from all members of the group and (hopefully) their solutions.

```R
# Let's get to coding! 
me<-c('excited,'to','code')
```
