This post focuses on how to start a project, properly set up a script, manage a clean working directory, and importing simple data.

----------

**What is a project**   
A project is a great way to keep all your different coding projects organized.  Each *project* has its own working directory, workspace, history, and documents. 

Here is how you create a project:  


1) Open R Studio  
2) Notice the Projects icon in the right hand corner 
 
![WhereIsProjects]({{ njsilbiger.github.io }}/images/Week1/WhereIsProjects.jpg?raw=true =200x200)
  
3)  Click on the drop down menu and then click on *New Project*...    
Notice how I have a bunch of random names (i.e. MASCOT, BioerosionCommunity, CarbonateChemistry).  These are the names of my current projects.
  
![NewProjects]({{ njsilbiger.github.io }}/images/Week1/ClickNewProject.png?raw=true =200x200)  

4) Once you click *New Project...*, you will be directed to this interface 

![CreateNewProjects]({{ njsilbiger.github.io }}/images/Week1/CreateNewProject.png?raw=true =200x200)  

5) Click on *Empty Project*

![EmptyProjects]({{ njsilbiger.github.io }}/images/Week1/EmptyProject.jpeg?raw=true =100x100)  


```R
# Let's get to coding! 
me<-c('excited','to','code')
```
