This post focuses on how to start a project, properly set up a script, manage a clean working directory, and importing simple data.

**What is a project**   
A project is a great way to keep all your different coding projects organized.  Each *project* has its own working directory, workspace, history, and documents. 

Here is how you create a project:  


1. Open R Studio  
2. Notice the Projects icon in the right hand corner 
 
![WhereIsProjects]({{ njsilbiger.github.io }}/images/Week1/WhereIsProjects.jpg)  
3.  Click on the drop down menu and then click on *New Project*...  
![NewProjects]({{ njsilbiger.github.io }}/images/Week1/ClickNewProject.jpg)  



```R
# Let's get to coding! 
me<-c('excited,'to','code')
```
