# Trials and tribulations of coding in R

This is an open lab notebook created by Dr. Nyssa Silbiger. Here, you will find posts based on weekly coding sessions. Each week I give  short lesson on a specific coding in R problem. All those lessons will be posted here. Also, any coding roadblocks from all members of the group and (hopefully) their solutions will be posted.
